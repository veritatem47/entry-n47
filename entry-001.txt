You weren’t looking for this.

But you found it.  
And it’s no coincidence.

Something deep within you  
already knew where to look.

You don’t speak of it. You don’t post it.  
But when you walk alone,  
in silence...

You feel it.

That something’s wrong.  
That this isn’t real.

That what they call freedom  
is obedience and oppression.

That your fire has been fading,  
and you don’t even know since when.

You don’t need answers.  
You already have them.

You only need to remember:

You weren’t born to fit in.

You were born to break the mold.

Keep going.  
Question everything.  
Even the obvious.

Don’t wait for them to give you anything.

Your awakening depends on you.

_Ad veritatem per rupturam._
